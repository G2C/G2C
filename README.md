Gen2Coin - a Social currency built from the popular Litecoin source code optimized for CPU and GPU mining using scrypt as a proof of work scheme.
 - 5 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 420k blocks (~4 years)
 - only 42,000,000 coins
 - a brand new GUI

The rest is the same as Litecoin at the moment.
 - 50 coins per block
 - 2016 blocks to retarget difficulty


Development process
===================
 - This is V1 it needs much development.


GENERAL ToDo list v1
===================
 - Register a domain and make a website [DONE]
 - Make a logo [DONE]
 - Get more coders, at least one that knows Qt very well
 - Customize the website with new descriptive text
 - Customize the website with new images
 - Improve forum
 - Get a ToDo list for graphic designers, coders, text writers...
 - Study the code to get an idea of what we should change
 - Change said things
 - Set up a mining pool
 - Set up a trading website
 - Convince someone to accept this currency as donations


CODER ToDo list v1
===================
 - Get more coders
 - Study the code to know what needs to be changed (it would be basically to make sure that there are no Litecoins traces or dependant variables remaining on the code. We should need to study the code first and note or change immediatly things that need to be changed to make sure we are not referencing Litecoins where we shouldn't)
 - UPDATE IF MORE SUGGERENCES ARE NEEDED!

#ENGINE changes#
 - [ENGINE] Change block generation rate [DONE]
 - [ENGINE] Change the genesis hash [Due prior to release]
 - Think about other engine changes if needed

#GUI changes#
 - [GUI] Make it prettier by changing the layout/color scheme (see GD/brainstormer suggerences)
 - [GUI] Change the default LiteCoin graphical assets by the ones created by the GD
 - [SUGGERENCE] Making a GUI based on HTML5 and/or add a WebUI to make an easy browser integration
 - Think about more changes (see brainstormer suggerences)

#ADDONS#
 - [ADDON] Integrated CPU/GPU miner, preferabily integrated with the GUI
 - [POSSIBLE ADDON] Direct login to major trading sites as MtGox/BTC-e. We may have to ask for an API if they don't already have one
 - [POSSIBLE ADDON] Browser integration as a plugin? Chrome/Firefox
 - Think about addons (see brainstormer suggerences)

#ALTCLIENTS#
 - [ALTCLIENT] Android client --Would the HTML5 GUI be easy to port to android?
 - [ALTCLIENT] iOS client
 - [ALTCLIENT] Light client, only when the P2P-web is big enough
